My name is Johannes Tölle and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in the group of [Prof. Chan](https://www.chan-lab.caltech.edu/). 
I studied chemistry at the University of Münster from 2013 to 2018. I finished my Bachelor's in 2016 and my Master's in 2018. In my master thesis, I was working on reduced orbital spaces in time-dependent density-functional theory in the group of Prof. Neugebauer.
During my Master's, I conducted a research stay in the group of [Prof. Pavanello](https://sites.rutgers.edu/prg) at Rutgers Newark. There I developed an impurity model which allows treating charged subsystems in periodic boundary conditions.
Subsequently, I performed my PhD (from Oct. 2018 to Sep. 2021) in the group of [Prof. Neugebauer](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Chemie.oc/neugebauer/neugebauer.html), where I was working on subsystem-based modeling of photo-induced processes.
