My name is Johannes Tölle, and I am currently a junior research group leader at the [University of Hamburg](https://www.chemie.uni-hamburg.de/institute/ac/arbeitsgruppen/herrmann/team/mitarbeiter/johannestoelle.html) in the field of theoretical chemistry.
The main focus of my research is to understand how electron interactions in different materials give rise to their diverse properties. The complexity of this problem necessitates the development of novel, efficient, accurate, and interpretable quantum mechanical simulation methods. In my group, we develop theoretical tools that allow us to gain insights into the fundamental processes occurring in various materials.

Before my current position, I was a junior research group leader at the University of Münster and a postdoctoral researcher at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in the group of [Prof. Chan](https://www.chan-lab.caltech.edu/). 
I studied chemistry at the University of Münster from 2013 to 2018, completing my Bachelor's degree in 2016 and my Master's degree in 2018. For my Master's thesis, I worked on reduced orbital spaces in time-dependent density-functional theory in Prof. Neugebauer's group.
During my Master's studies, I conducted a research stay in the group of [Prof. Pavanello](https://sites.rutgers.edu/prg) at Rutgers Newark, where I developed an impurity model for treating charged subsystems in periodic boundary conditions.
Subsequently, I pursued my PhD (from Oct. 2018 to Sep. 2021) in the group of [Prof. Neugebauer](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Chemie.oc/neugebauer/neugebauer.html), where I was working on subsystem-based modeling of photo-induced processes.
